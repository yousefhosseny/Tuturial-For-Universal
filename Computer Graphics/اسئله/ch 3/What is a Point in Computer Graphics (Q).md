Here is a complete set of **exam-style study questions** covering all the requested types:

---

## **üìå Quick Recall Questions**

#### **1. What is a point in computer graphics?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** A point is the smallest unit in computer graphics, like a tiny dot on the screen.

---

#### **2. How does a computer determine where to place a point?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** By using a coordinate system (X, Y).

---

#### **3. What is a frame buffer?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** A type of memory in raster displays where each pixel has a value that determines whether it is on (1) or off (0).

---

#### **4. What is the main difference between vector and raster displays?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** A vector display moves the electron beam directly to the point, while a raster display updates a frame buffer that controls the pixels.

---

#### **5. How does a CRT monitor display a point?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** It uses an electron beam to light up the correct position on the screen.

---

## **‚úÖ True or False Questions**

#### **6. A point is the largest unit in computer graphics.**

‚ùå **False** (A point is the smallest unit in computer graphics.)

---

#### **7. A coordinate system is used to determine the position of a point.**

‚úÖ **True**

---

#### **8. In a raster display, a pixel value of 0 means it is turned on (white).**

‚ùå **False** (A pixel value of 0 means it is off (black).)

---

#### **9. A vector display updates a frame buffer to control the pixels.**

‚ùå **False** (A vector display directly controls the electron beam to draw points.)

---

#### **10. A raster display works by updating a frame buffer, and the screen follows these instructions.**

‚úÖ **True**

---

## **üîÑ Compare Questions**

#### **11. Compare vector and raster displays in terms of how they store and display points.**

‚úÖ **Answer:**

- **Vector Display:** Stores instructions for each point and moves the electron beam to the exact position.
    
- **Raster Display:** Stores pixel data in a frame buffer and updates the screen based on stored values.
    

---

#### **12. Compare how old CRT monitors and modern raster displays show a point.**

‚úÖ **Answer:**

- **CRT Monitor:** Uses an electron beam to light up a specific location.
    
- **Raster Display:** Uses a frame buffer to store pixel values and lights up the corresponding pixels.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Reason and Order Questions**

#### **13. Why does a computer use a coordinate system to display a point instead of drawing like a human?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** Because computers work with numbers and need precise positioning, a coordinate system helps determine exact locations mathematically.

---

#### **14. Arrange the following steps in order for how a raster display shows a point:**

1. The frame buffer is updated.
    
2. The screen follows the instructions in the frame buffer.
    
3. The correct pixel is turned on.
    

‚úÖ **Answer:** 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3

---

#### **15. Explain why vector displays do not need a frame buffer, but raster displays do.**

‚úÖ **Answer:** Vector displays draw directly using electron beams, while raster displays rely on a stored pixel grid in memory, making a frame buffer necessary.

---

## **üéØ Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**

#### **16. What does the coordinate (5,10) mean in a 2D space?**

A) Move 10 steps right and 5 steps up  
B) Move 5 steps right and 10 steps up  
C) Move 5 steps left and 10 steps down  
D) Move 10 steps left and 5 steps down

‚úÖ **Answer:** B) Move 5 steps right and 10 steps up

---

#### **17. What happens when a pixel value is set to 1 in a raster display?**

A) The pixel turns off (black)  
B) The pixel turns on (white)  
C) The pixel disappears  
D) The pixel is dim but visible

‚úÖ **Answer:** B) The pixel turns on (white)

---

#### **18. How does a vector display work?**

A) It remembers instructions for each point and moves the electron beam to that position  
B) It updates a frame buffer to control individual pixels  
C) It uses a mathematical function to generate colors  
D) It refreshes the screen at a constant rate

‚úÖ **Answer:** A) It remembers instructions for each point and moves the electron beam to that position

---

#### **19. What is the function of a frame buffer in modern raster displays?**

A) It stores pixel values that determine brightness  
B) It controls the movement of the electron beam  
C) It generates 3D images automatically  
D) It processes sound signals for the display

‚úÖ **Answer:** A) It stores pixel values that determine brightness

---

## **üí° Concept Questions**

#### **20. What is the main function of an electron beam in a CRT monitor?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** It moves to the correct position and lights up that specific area on the screen.

---

#### **21. What happens when a raster display updates its frame buffer?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** The screen follows the updated pixel values and lights up the corresponding points.

---

#### **22. Why is a point important in computer graphics?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** It is the smallest unit in graphics and serves as the basis for all images.

---
