## **üìå Quick Recall Questions**

#### **1. How does a computer represent a line?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** A computer represents a line as a series of pixels placed close together in a stepwise manner.

---

#### **2. What equation does a raster system use to determine line positions?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** The equation **y = m * x + b**, where **m** is the slope and **b** is the y-intercept.

---

#### **3. What is the main difference between a vector system and a raster system when drawing lines?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** A **vector system** moves smoothly between points, while a **raster system** selects specific pixels to approximate the line.

---

#### **4. What role does the slope (m) play in the line equation?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** The slope **m** determines how steep the line is.

---

#### **5. How does a vector pen plotter draw lines?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** By moving a pen smoothly from the start point to the endpoint using continuous signals.

---

## **‚úÖ True or False Questions**

#### **6. A computer sees a line as a continuous smooth shape.**

‚ùå **False** (A computer sees a line as discrete pixels arranged in a stepwise manner.)

---

#### **7. Raster graphics systems must choose exact pixels to represent a line.**

‚úÖ **True**

---

#### **8. The line equation y = m * x + b is used only in vector systems.**

‚ùå **False** (It is used in raster systems to calculate pixel positions.)

---

#### **9. The y-intercept (b) in the equation y = m * x + b determines where the line crosses the x-axis.**

‚ùå **False** (It determines where the line crosses the **y-axis**.)

---

#### **10. Vector plotters use pixel-based calculations to draw lines.**

‚ùå **False** (They use continuous movement to draw smooth lines.)

---

## **üîÑ Compare Questions**

#### **11. Compare vector and raster methods of drawing lines.**

‚úÖ **Answer:**

- **Vector system:** Moves smoothly between two points, using continuous signals.

---

#### **12. Compare the roles of the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) in the equation y = m * x + b.**

‚úÖ **Answer:**

- **Slope (m):** Controls the steepness of the line.
    
- **Y-intercept (b):** Defines where the line crosses the y-axis.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Reason and Order Questions**

#### **13. Why does a raster system need to calculate pixel positions for a line?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** Because it cannot draw smooth lines directly and must approximate them using discrete pixels.

---

#### **14. Arrange the following steps in order for how a raster system draws a line:**

1. Identify the start and end points.
    
2. Calculate the slope (m) and y-intercept (b).
    
3. Compute intermediate points using the line equation.
    
4. Fill in pixels at the computed positions.
    

‚úÖ **Answer:** 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4

#### **15. Why do vector systems produce smoother lines than raster systems?**

‚úÖ **Answer:** Because vector systems move continuously between points instead of approximating with pixels.

C) It moves a pen smoothly from one point to another.  
D) It only draws horizontal or vertical lines.

‚úÖ **Answer:** B) It uses the equation **y = m * x + b** to calculate positions.

---

#### **17. What does the slope (m) represent in the equation y = m * x + b?**

A) The thickness of the line  
B) The position of the line on the screen  
C) How steep the line is  
D) The number of pixels in the line

‚úÖ **Answer:** C) How steep the line is

---

#### **18. What is the purpose of the y-intercept (b) in the line equation?**

A) It determines the line's thickness.  
B) It decides the brightness of the line.  
C) It tells where the line crosses the y-axis.  
D) It sets the direction of the line.

‚úÖ **Answer:** C) It tells where the line crosses the y-axis.

---

#### **19. How does a raster system decide which pixels to activate for a line?**

A) By selecting random pixels near the expected path  
B) By using a mathematical equation to approximate the line  
C) By moving smoothly between two points  
D) By turning on every pixel on the screen

‚úÖ **Answer:** B) By using a mathematical equation to approximate the line
